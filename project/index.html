            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>Currently i'm a student at Queen's University. I'm studying an MSc in software
                development. My course covers several important topics such as programming,
                database design and web development. My course will finish this year in September
                and I'm keen to get started in a new career as a software engineer.

                Previously I lived and worked in South Korea as an English teacher/professor. My
                day to day tasks involved preparing interesting materials and presenting them in an
                engaging way. Communication and teamwork were essential on account of the language
                barrier. If you'd like to know more about me you can find my contact information and
                my linkedin to the right.
